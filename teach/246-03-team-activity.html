        <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Parsing XML Team Activity</span></h1>

        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Instructions</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Meet with your team for a synchronous meeting before Wednesday of this week. For this meeting, you may use whatever technology you like (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.), but you need to be able to see and hear each other, and to share your screens. You can work on a shared Java file, or individually on the your own copies of this file, but in the end, each person will need to turn in a copy. If you choose to work on separate copies, make sure you stay right in sync with one another to ensure that everyone finishes together.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This activity is designed to take about 1 hour, and will help prepare you for your individual assignment due at the end of the week.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Assignment</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Your assignment is to use Java to parse an XML document using the DOM approach (i.e., use the classes: javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder and org.w3c.dom.Document).</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">See <a href="../attachments/246-03-conference.xml" target="_blank">this XML file</a> containing General Conference speakers. As a team, write a Java program that will parse the XML file to identify speakers and display their names to the screen (one per line). You may hardcode the filename of the XML file into your program if you wish.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Submission</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Each member of the team should upload a copy of the .java file to I-Learn by Wednesday at 11:59 PM. Also, in the submission comments box, please specify which of the following were completed (and which were deficient).</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Every member of our team was present for the activity.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program compiles.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program loads an XML file into a Document object.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program iterates through at least some nodes of the document.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program prints at least some names to the screen.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program prints all names to the screen.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Program gracefully ends (XML file is closed, and the program does not crash).</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">See attached for an XML file.</span></p>
