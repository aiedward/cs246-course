        <h1>Team Activity: Test Driven Development</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Please read the <a href="../prepare/246-08-prepare.html">preparation material</a> before meeting with your team for this activity, so that your time together can be as efficient as possible.</p>
        <p>This week you will get exposed to writing automated test cases. This is a major component of effective software engineering and helping projects succeed. Learning to write good test cases will help you think through your design decisions more clearly, develop your code more systematically, and will yield huge dividends in the maintenance and support phases of your projects. In future classes you will learn more about testing and different testing strategies, but in this class you should be exposed to the concepts, learn the mechanics and see the value.</p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>For this activity, you will write some unit tests that will be part of your team project. The goal of this activity is that you will start some tests now, and then continue to develop them throughout the rest of your project.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As a team, choose three classes that need to be tested (from your design).</li>
            <li>For the purposes of this activity, each team member should be in charge of implementing tests for a different class. Please follow along with the others on their classes.</li>
            <li>If these classes do not yet exist, create the class and at least two methods that will need to be tested. At least one of these methods should be more complicated than a getter/setter.</li>
            <li>*** Please note that at this point these classes may not have any functionality. That is just fine! Create the method with the correct parameters and return type, and then just return "null" if necessary.</li>
            <li>Write one test case for each of these methods (this should be 2 test cases per person, if you have a team of 3, or 6 total).</li>
            <li>The test case should Assert that the correct value was return from the method, and fail if this value is not returned.</li>
            <li>*** Please note that this means almost of your test cases will be failing right now. This is just fine. Then, as you implement this functionality, you are making your tests pass.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Make sure that your code is committed to your team GitHub repository. Then each team member should answer the following I-Learn questions.</p>
