        <h1>Team Activity: Project Features</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The team activity this week will be different than most, in that it will not have an additional assignment and deliverable associated with it. Instead, your task is to meet together as a group and work on solidifying the plan for your project, including the feature list.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that you can only do so much of this without feedback from and interaction with your sponsor.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Meet with your team in a synchronous meeting (i.e., Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.)</li>
            <li>Nail down the specifics of what your project should be and do.</li>
            <li>Determine the list of features you are committing to.</li>
            <li>Determine the list of stretch goals you would also like to achieve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may need to adjust these items during the week as you have further communication with your sponsor, but once you establish the Statement of work this week, you are committed to deliver them.</p>
        <p>Please refer to the Statement of Work / Project Proposal document in I-Learn for additional instructions about what you need to deliver at the end of the week.</p>
