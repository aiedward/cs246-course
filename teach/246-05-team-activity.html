        <h1>Team Activity - Android Hello World</h1>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Your team assignment for this week is to help everyone in your team get a "Hello World" application to compile and run in an Android emulator.</p>
        <p>On the surface (and if all goes well), this should be very simple and straightforward, and yet, there always seem to be challenges that arise.</p>
        <p>Before meeting as a team, make sure you have each downloaded and installed your IDEs.</p>
        <p>This semester we will be using Android Studio for our development environment. This is a powerful IDE that can enable us to do great things, but it does take a little bit of setting up and getting used to.</p>
        <h3>Completion</h3>
        <p>Your score for this assignment is as follows:</p>
        <p>50% - Getting your own Hello World application to compile and run.</p>
        <p>25% - Teammate #1 gets their application to compile and run.</p>
        <p>25% - Teammate #2 gets their application to compile and run.</p>
        <p>Please mark in the I-Learn assessment for what you were each able to complete<span>&nbsp;by 11:59 PM on Saturday.</span></p>
        <p>If you have two members on your team, count your other teammate as both "Teammate #1" and "Teammate #2". If there are four members on the team, mark "Teammate #2" successful when everyone on the team completes the assignment.
