        <h2>Week 02 :: Overview</h2>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>This week you will learn how to create a basic Android app and how to upload your Android assignments to GitHub. There is quite a bit to do this week, so stay on top of things. There will be quite a bit of Java code in the app that you might not understand yet. Feel free to research this on your own, but we will be discussing it in week 03.</p>

        <p>Be aware however, that this course is unlike other courses you may have taken in the past. A lot of what you need to know, you'll have to research and learn on your own. The course assignments and reading provide a baseline to guide you, but much of the information you need to complete assignments and projects will be things you need to find on your own using the many resources available on the internet.</p>

        <p>Critically important this week is the team formation for the project. Make sure you visit the discussion board throughout the week in order to discuss project ideas and form teams.</p>
