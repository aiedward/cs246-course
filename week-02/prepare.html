        <h2>Prepare 2.0 :: Introduction to Android Studio</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Learn about Android Studio.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn about Java programming style.</p></li>
            <li><p>Download and install Android Studio.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn about app development.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Android Studio</h3>
        <p>Througout this course we will be using the Android operating system to learn Java, and the principles of software design and development. If you don't have an Android device, don't worry. You can use the built-in Android emulator or a 3rd party Android emulator to simulate an Android phone on your computer.</p>

        <h3>Java Style</h3>

        <p>An important component of software development, especially when working with others, is learning to use a consistent programming style. This is especially important when multiple developers are contributing to the same codebase.</p>

        <p>Using a consistent style in a project provides the following benefits:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>It will help developers to navigate through the code more quickly.</p></li>
            <li><p>It helps you to spot errors.</p></li>
            <li><p>It reduces the cost of code maintenance</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most languages have a generally accepted style guide for that language. In addition, many companies have their own software style guides. Learning to follow a style guide is an important skill.</p>

        <p>In this course, we will use one of the most popular style guides for Java programming, <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">the Google Java Style guide.</a></p>
        
        <p>This style is likely different than what you're used to using when programming in C++. For example, it uses the &ldquo;K &amp; R style&rdquo; of braces (Style Rule 4.1.2), where the opening brace appears on the same line as the method name or if statement:</p>
<pre><code class="java">if (expression) {
   statement;
   statement;
}
</code></pre>
        

        <h4>Before Class, complete the following:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z98hXV9GmzY">this video from Google</a>, which provides an overview of Android Development and Android Studio. Follow along with the steps in the video to download Android Studio, and test it out on your computer.</p>
                <p>If you have trouble getting the default emulator to run, you might need to change some configuration options on your machine. The answers on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21635504/error-during-installing-haxm-vt-x-not-working" target="_blank">this Stack Overflow post</a> explain the most common issues.</p>
                <p>If all else fails, you can use install and configure a 3rd party Android emulator, such as <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/download" target="_blank">Genymotion. (You'll need to create an account on their site to download the free version for individuals)</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Take some time to become familiar with <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">Google's Java style guide</a>, especially the formatting requirements from section 4.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>Make sure you complete the Prepare quiz for week 02 on I-Learn.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
