        <h3>Branching</h3>
        <p>One of the most powerful features of git is the concept of branches. When you create a branch in git, it's like creating a seperate workspace in the project just for you. You can make changes in your branch, experiement with new ideas, and even commit your work, without disrupting the code in the rest of the project. Once you're ready for your changes to become part of the project, you can <em>merge</em> your branch. If you decide your changes were a bad idea, you can simply delete the branch.</p>
