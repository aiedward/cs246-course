        <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Agreement</span></h1>

        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">First, watch this video for some inspiration:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y</a>&nbsp;(Transcript - <a href="../attachments/246-03-everything-is-awesome.docx">lyrics</a>)</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Perhaps the largest factor that will contribute to the success of our team projects will be our ability to work well as part of a team. Working as a team has the potential to create challenges in school projects, and it can also cause those same challenges in the workplace! And yet, almost all software is developed by teams, so learning to work well with others is a critical component of this course and this degree.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">One of the keys to being successful is to establish expectations at the beginning of the project. The purpose of this team contract is to help us specify the expectations we have for ourselves and each other, as well as other items, such as how we plan to resolve conflicts, etc.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Some of the items on this contract are spelled out specifically, others are framed for you, but require you to determine the specifics, and others are left wide open.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Please take this seriously, because we will hold to it firmly throughout the semester.</span></p>
        <p>Please use <a href="../attachments/246-03-team-agreement.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf</a> as a template, and fill in the blank sections to make it your own.
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Work with your team to complete the contract. Then, each team member must "sign it" and submit it to I-Learn&nbsp;by 11:59 PM on Saturday.</span></p>
