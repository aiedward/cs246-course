            <h1>Team Formation Forum</h1>
            <p>As noted in the Team Formation instructions, you need to self-identify teams of 3 these week. This forum is designed to aid in that process.</p>

            <p>In this forum, please take a minute to introduce yourself. Tell us each a little about yourself and where you come from. Then, please list the project ideas that seem most interesting to you at this point.</p>

            <p>Then, please comment on other people's posts to start to come together on a team and potential ideas. You don't need to commit to an idea this week, but hopefully you have a direction in mind.</p>

            <p>There are no points associated with this forum, but rather, the assignment is to submit your team recommendation. This is simply a help toward that end.</p>
