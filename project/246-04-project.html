        <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Project Statement of Work</span></h1>

        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Overview</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">As a team, you need to develop a brief proposal for your team project. This will define what the project is, and what features you are committing to include.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The expectation is that this is your major deliverable for this week, so plan to spend time on it, talking with your sponsor and working as a team to tune it, rather than throwing together a quick list of things, last minute.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Also, please note that this is a contract between you and your sponsor of what you are committing to accomplish. You will be held accountable for delivering each of these features, so be conscious of what you promise. It is much better to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around. This doesn't mean just put "Hello World" as the only required feature so you can nail it! But it does mean that you need to be thoughtful about what are the basic core features that your sponsor wants and that must be present for the solution to be workable, and balance this with what you feel comfortable committing to.</span></p>
        <p>In addition, you will list as stretch goals, features that you hope to be able to include along with the required features.</p>
        <p>Please note that to get 90% (Good) on the "requirements" line item of the final project rubric, you must complete the required features. In order to get 100% (Exceptional, not just good) for that line item, you will be expected to complete some stretch goals as well.</p>

        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Submission</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">As a team, <a href="../attachments/246-04-statement_of_work.pdf" target="_blank">this template PDF</a>, then the project manager is responsible to get the required signatures and submit it to I-Learn on behalf of the team by 11:59 PM on Saturday. (You do not need to get the instructor's signature before submitting to I-Learn.)</span></p>
