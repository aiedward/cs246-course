        <h1>Team Project: Finished App Submission</h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Please upload your finished app to I-Learn.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This is due at the end of this week, leaving you some time next week to arrange a demo/delivery with your sponsor and a chance to prepare your project report, where you will reflect upon the process and the product you were able to produce.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">In other words, this is your last week to finish any changes to the code.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Submission Instructions</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333330154419px;">The architect for each team should upload an APK file with your app (i.e., only one submission per team is necessary).</span></span>
