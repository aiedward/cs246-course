            <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Formation Instructions</span></h1>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana,geneva;">By the end of this week, you need to form a team of 2-3 students (4 is too many, and 1 is not a team). Hopefully at this point, you will also have a loose idea of the project that you want to work on.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">You get to recommend your own teams. The instructor will try to honor these recommendations wherever possible, but may need to assign an additional member or move some people around to make sure that everyone has a team.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">To help in deciding your teams, please use the weekly discussion board to share ideas of what you are interested in, follow up with others on their ideas, etc. <span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Don&rsquo;t forget that you will need to meet at least once per week with your team for a synchronous meeting (e.g., Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) before Wednesday night, so make sure you will be able to find a time that works for everyone.</span>
                <br />
                </span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">By Saturday night, each person (not just one per team) should submit to I-Learn their recommendation for team members and the basic idea of the project you are considering (1-2 sentences is sufficient for this), and a potential sponsor if you have one in mind. We will formalize this next week.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">If you do not select a team by Saturday night, the instructor will assign you to one.</span></p>
