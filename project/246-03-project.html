        <h1>Pre-proposal and Sponsor Identification</h1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In addition to defining your team agreement this week, you also need to decide on a basic idea of what you are going to build and identify a the person who will be your sponsor. Next week you will formalize this description of your product and list the features that you will commit to, and also get a formal commitment from your sponsor, but this week you should have a basic idea of what you want to build and someone that you have found to work with.</p>
        <h3>Having a Sponsor</h3>
        <p>One of the most important elements of our team projects is that we are developing software to bless the life of someone else. These sponsors will be a stakeholder in the success and the functionality of the project. As we work with them to define requirements, and refine them them later, we will develop important skills. And also, as we produce software that will really fill a need and have someone counting on us, it changes the way we view our work.</p>
        <p>The question is always asked, "Can I be my own sponsor?". The problem with this is that we lose the benefits described above. If you have an idea for a project, that is fine, but you would need to find someone else who could be a stakeholder in it, and let them sponsor the project.</p>
        <p>"Can my sponsor be my spouse or my mom?" - Possibly, but not necessarily. If that person is a real stakeholder, then yes, but if they are simply there to say "whatever you want, dear" then it doesn't work. For example, if my mom sponsors my triathlon training app, but she doesn't train for them, it doesn't work. But if she sponsors my quilting app, because she is an avid quilter, then that is perfect.</p>
        <h3>Working with a sponsor</h3>
        <p>Each sponsor needs to be willing to commit a certain amount of time to help with the project. They do not need to manage it, and they certainly do not pay anything for it. They are making themselves available to help in our learning experience, and hopefully get something helpful in return.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the sponsor is not part of the class, and likely has many other responsibilities on their plate. Their time is very valuable and their schedule is likely full. In this regard, we need to keep the following in mind:</p>
        <p>When we meet with our sponsors (over the phone or in person or anything else), we should should be courteous, respectful, and gracious. We should be efficient and have a very specific set of items to make them aware of and questions to ask, and not take any more time than necessary.</p>
        <p>When we need to schedule a meeting with the sponsor and the entire team, we should contact the sponsor well in advance, recognizing that their schedule may not accommodate an immediate time.</p>
        <p>Even though the project manager will be the point of contact between the team and the sponsor, it is important for everyone on the team to meet the sponsor.</p>
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Since you need to identify a sponsor this week, you should make contact with them and make sure they are comfortable with the process and willing to work with you to define requirements and then maintain weekly contact throughout the semester. This assignment should be completed by Saturday at 11:59 PM.</p>
