        <h1>Feature Change Request</h1>
        <p>A change to the core promised features of the application should be very rare. We should think carefully about the features and requirements we commit to before starting the project.</p>
        <p>However, there may be times when an unforeseen circumstance simply makes it impossible to complete a feature as planned. For example, a core API that you were planning to use does not exist or work the way you needed, and there is not a reasonable workaround, or the data that a feature was built around is not available as planned. Please note that &ldquo;we ran out of time&rdquo; is not a valid reason.</p>
        <p>In these cases, you need to download the PDF <a href="../attachments/246-feature-change-request.pdf" target="_blank">Feature Change Request form</a> and email a copy to both your sponsor and your instructor.</p>
