        <h1>Team Project: First Thoughts Pitch</h1>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>The majority of this semester will be spent working in teams developing a real project for a real sponsor. Part of your responsibility is to find a sponsor and a project to work on. It will be turned in as your final during the last week of class. You will be expected to show consistent progress through a series of deliverable milestones.</p>
        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, please read the <a href="246-project-overview.html">Team Project Overview</a>&nbsp;to understand what this project is all about.</p>
        <p>To help get the juices flowing for this project, this week you need to start talking to people around you (neighbors, bosses, co-workers, family members, etc.) to see what ideas you can find, and then give a &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; for one of these ideas on the <span>Project &ndash; First Thoughts Pitch discussion board</span>.</p>
        <p>This is not a commitment that you will have to work on this project nor that your contact is committing to be a sponsor, but rather a chance to have a little bit of a group brainstorming project and to help as we will be forming teams around ideas next week.</p>
        <p>Remember to keep these very brief and to the point. A sentence or two or a few bullet points should be sufficient.</p>
        <p>Please use the Project &ndash; First Thoughts Pitch discussion board to post your idea, and look at some of the ideas your peers are posting. You will need to post by Saturday to get any credit.</p>
