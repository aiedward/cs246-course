        <h1>Code Conventions and Style</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>An important component of software development, especially when working with others, is using consistent style. It will help you navigate through the code more quickly and avoid errors.</p>
        <p>In industry, your company (if it&rsquo;s a good company) will require you to conform to a style guide. It may be different than the one each employee has used previously, but it will help them all work consistently. In addition, much of the cost of software development is in maintenance, and usually, this is done by someone besides the original author. Thus, learning to code to a style guide is a very valuable skill.</p>
        <p>In this class we will use the Google Java Style guide found here:</p>
        <p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank">https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html</a></p>
        <p>This is a very common style guideline for Java, with many companies using this guide or slight variations of it. Please note that this style is different than what you may be comfortable with from C++. For example, we will use the &ldquo;K &amp; R style&rdquo; of braces (4.1.2), where the opening brace appears on the same line as the method name or if statement, such as:</p>
        <p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">if (expression) {<br /></span><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; statement;<br /></span><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; statement;<br /></span><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: 12pt;">}</span></p>
        <p>This takes some getting used to if you are coming from a different bracing style, but this really is the standard for Java.</p>
        <p>The only exception we will make to the style guide is that we will not require 2 spaces for block indentation. You may indent with however many spaces you prefer (or your editor defaults to) as long as it is consistent.</p>
        <p>Please take a minute to get familiar with the style guide, especially the formatting requirements from section 4.</p>
