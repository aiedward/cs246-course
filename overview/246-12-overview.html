        <h1>Lesson 12 Overview</h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">It should not be surprising that the main task for this week is the development of your team project.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">For your team activity this week, you will get a chance to identify and apply some of the design patterns that you have been studying. At this point, you are familiar with several of them and should be able to spot cases where they may apply, even if you have to look up the specifics of the pattern to implement it.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Lesson Objectives:</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Be able to recognize and apply design patterns appropriately.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Make progress toward final team project.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Individual Preparation</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">You will want to complete the reading and individual design pattern quiz before your team activity, so that you have this week's pattern in your toolbelt.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The rest of the time that you would have spent on an individual programming assignment should be devoted to working on your team project.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Project</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">There are technically no deliverables this week for the project, but we are now in the final stretch of development, so make sure to keep focused and continue making good progress.</span></p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Don't forget that each person needs to turn in a weekly status report.</span>
