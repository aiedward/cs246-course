        <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Lesson 14 Overview</span></h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">In this final week of the course you will have a final exam to demonstrate your knowledge of Java and Design Patterns.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">You will also need to do two things to finalize your project. First, by Wednesday of this week, you need to meet with your sponsor to demo and deliver your project. After doing this, you also need email your sponsor a link to the "Sponsor Feedback" survey.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The second thing you need to do to evaluate your project is to complete a final project report. In this document, you will evaluate how well your project fulfills the different criteria prescribed in the rubric. You will also give an evaluation of your team members and their contributions to the project. There are instructions and a sample document provided in I-Learn that you can use as a template. Plan to spend some time on this document to give an honest reflection of the work that you have done.</span></p>
