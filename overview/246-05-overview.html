        <h1>Lesson 05 Overview</h1>

        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This week, we will begin working with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which can be a lot of fun compared to only working with files and command line programs. On the other hand, it also requires us to change our thinking to an "event driven" style of programming, where our methods respond to actions the user makes, rather than executing linear, pre-defined steps.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The process of working with a GUI and working with events is very similar in different languages, and different types of platforms (e.g., desktop vs. mobile apps). Because we are going to be doing Android mobile app development for our team projects, we are going to dive into that as our GUI of choice. This means that a major component of your work this week is to get an Android development environment up and running, including an emulator, and be able to write and test code there.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This semester we will be using Android Studio for our development environment. This is a powerful IDE that can enable us to do great things, but it does take a little bit of setting up and getting used to.<span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">For your team activity, the assignment is simply to work with your teammates to ensure that everyone can run a simple Android Hello World application. Your grade is dependent upon everyone on the team getting it to work.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">For the individual activity, you will then create a simple app that transitions between two "screens."</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Also this week, you will begin studying design patterns and have a quiz on your first design pattern. From this point on, you will learn about roughly one new pattern each week, so that by the end of the semester you will have a list of them that you can choose among, to help solve more complicated problems.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">For your team project you will work together to identify potential risks and unknowns.</span></p>

        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Individual Assignment</span></h3>
        <div>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">You are responsible to read about design patterns and take the quiz by Wednesday evening.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Also, there is an individual assignment due on Saturday night on multithreaded programming.</span></p>
        </div>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Project</span></h3>
        <div><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This week as a team, you need to identify the pieces of your project that are unknown to you or carry the largest risk. Some examples may include, looking into any APIs you will need to use, tracking down any algorithms that you need (e.g., processing sound or image data), or looking into file formats that you need to handle. This week you only need to identify these risks and what you could do to mitigate them, then, next week you will actually work on them.</span></div>
