        <h1>Lesson 11 Overview</h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Once again, the main task for this week is the development of your team project.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Your weekly team activity will give you some basic experience with JavaDocs and the documentation that generates them, which you should be using in throughout your project.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Lesson Objectives:</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Understand the principles behind JavaDocs and how to generate them.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Make progress toward final team project.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Individual Preparation</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Once again, the only individual assignment this week is to complete the design pattern reading and take the accompanying quiz. There is a small amount of preparation material that you should go through before your team meeting to make your time spent together as efficient as possible.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The rest of the time that you would have spent on an individual programming assignment should be devoted to working on your team project.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Project</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Milestone 2 is due at the end of this week. That means you are accountable for all of the deliverables that you committed to. You should work together to make sure everyone is on the same page with regard to the milestone submission, and then each team member should submit a copy of it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Don't forget that each person needs to turn in a weekly status report.</span></p>
