        <h1>Lesson 08 Overview</h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The main task for this week is to begin in earnest (if you haven't already) the development of your team project. You should plan to spend the vast majority of your time on that project.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The weekly Team Activity will give you some basic experience with unit tests and the idea of Test Driven Development. Incorporating unit tests into your project will be very beneficial to tracking down bugs later in the semester.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Lesson Objectives:</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Understand the principles of unit testing and Test Driven Development.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Make progress toward final team project.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Individual Preparation</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The only individual assignment this week is to complete the design pattern reading and take the accompanying quiz. In addition, there is a small amount of preparation material that you should go through before your team meeting to make your time spent together as efficient as possible.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">The rest of the time that you would have spent on an individual programming assignment should be devoted to working on your team project.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Team Project</span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">As noted, this is where you will spend the bulk of your time this week (and from here on out). Make sure to observe all items in your team contract, communicate well with each other, and commit your code often. You may find it beneficial to do "pair-programming" with each other for some periods of time, rather than just dividing up and going your separate ways completely.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">There are technically no deliverables this week for the project, but you will need to be prepared for your milestone next week.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Don't forget that each person needs to turn in a weekly status report.</span></p>
