        <h1><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Lesson 03 Overview</span></h1>

        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">This week you will be getting even deeper into Java. You will work with XML documents to parse data using the DOM approach (e.g., using a DocumentBuilder). This will help you dive into another one of the built-in Java libraries. It will also give you a little more experience with classes and relationships among them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">To help prepare you for your individual assignment, you will have a team activity that will get you started with the basics of parsing an XML document. Because the team activities are designed to prepare you for your other work for the week, you need to meet early in the week (before Wednesday night at midnight) to work on this together. These meetings are a synchronous meeting where you use a screen sharing software (e.g., Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) so that you can see and hear one another, and also so you can share screens and look at the code they others are writing.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Also, for your team project this week, you need to work with your teammates to establish your Team Agreement. This is where you establish some the culture and expectations of your team. In addition, you will need to determine a rough overview of your project and identify a person to be your sponsor. You will formalize the features and the sponsor agreement next week. But this week, you will need to identify a person who is willing to sponsor the project.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 10pt;">Finally, now that we have learned how to write and compile our Java programs using basic bare-bones tools and the command line, we are ready to start using more advanced tools to aid in developing our code. It is important to understand at least some of the basics of how code is organized and compiled, otherwise the IDE just has &ldquo;magic buttons.&rdquo; But with that understanding, we can start to use more powerful tools to develop our software, in particular, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs, bring together tools to help write your code (such as code completion and syntax checking), help in organizing your code (tracking multiple files and dependencies), and ways to run and debug your code. These enable use to solve problem more quickly and spend our time on the more difficult problem solving tasks, as opposed to some of the more mundane and repetitive tasks.<br /><br />While an IDE is not required at this point, you are recommended to start looking into and using them. There are many IDEs for Java and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. For this class, we recommend the Netbeans IDE, which is free, sponsored by Oracle, and relatively easy to use off-the-shelf. It can be downloaded here: <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/" target="_blank">https://netbeans.org/downloads/</a> . (The basic version is fine for this class, but if you think you may continue on to classes such as CS 313, you should consider getting the &ldquo;all&rdquo; version. Later, when we begin Android development, you will get a separate IDE (Android Studio) for that.</span></p>
