        <h1>Individual Assignment: Android Scripture Reference</h1>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Your assignment is to create an Android app with two different Activities (pages).</p>
        <p>The first page should have three text boxes on it, one for a book, one for a chapter, and one for a verse. Each of these boxes should be labeled. This activity should then have a button labeled "Share" which causes the app to move to the second activity, passing the information from the text boxes.</p>
        <p>The second activity should receive the book, chapter, and verse from the first one and display the text, "Your favorite scripture is: D&amp;C 123:17", assuming D&amp;C 123:17 is the book, chapter, and verse from the first activity.</p>
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished the activity, push your project to your GitHub repository. Then, answer the attached questions.</span></p>
