        <h1>Individual Assignment: File I/O</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Create a Java program that counts the number of words per line in a text file.</p>
        <p>Please note that by design, this assignment (and future assignments) will leverage some of the fundamentals from the reading/quizzes, but it will also require you to do some digging on the Internet and working with your classmates to find solutions outside of the reading. This skill of learning to find good solutions is critical to your success in this class as well as in developing software in the real world.</p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a Java program that accepts a filename as a command line parameter.</li>
            <li>The program should open the file and read through it line by line.</li>
            <li>For each line, display the number of words on that line followed by a colon and then the text of the line. You may assume that spaces separate all words.</li>
            <li>If the file cannot be opened, the program should display an error message and exit gracefully.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Example</h3>
<div class="code">
java WordCounter woodruff.txt

Opening file 'woodruff.txt'...

7: You may have the administration of angels;
5: you may see many miracles;
8: you may see many wonders in the earth;
10: but I claim that the gift of the Holy Ghost
10: is the greatest gift that can be bestowed upon man.        
8: -Wilford Woodruff, Deseret Weekly, April 6, 1889, 451.
</div>
        <p>or like this:</p>

<div class="code">
java WordCounter aBadFile.txt

Opening file 'aBadFile.txt'...

Error reading 'aBadFile.txt'...
</div>

        <p>See the file: <a href="../attachments/246-01-woodruff.txt" target="_BLANK">246-01-woodruff.txt</a> as one example, but you should test your code on other files as well.</p>
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Please submit your .java file to I-Learn.</p>
        <p>NOTE: If you want to have more than one class/file for this assignment, that is great, but certainly not required at this point (but it will be required next week). If you do use multiple files, please zip up your source (the .java files) together and submit a single file to I-Learn</p>
        <p>Don't forget to follow the required course conventions with regard to naming, indentation, and bracing style. See <a href="../prepare/246-01-style.html">Code Conventions and Style</a> page.</p>
