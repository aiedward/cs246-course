        <h1>Version Control Assignment</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This exercise will give you a chance to see how committed you are to using version control and finding things among source that has been committed to a version control system.</p>
        <p>In particular, for this exercise we will be using Git, signing up for an account at GitHub, committing files to it, pulling files from it, and looking through the history of a Git repository.</p>
        <p>Use the internet and other students as a resource. The official git tutorial is at: <span><a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial</a></span></p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>The following steps will guide you through this activity. Each one is pass/fail.</p>
        <h4>Part I &ndash; Collaboration &ndash; 5%</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>(5%) Collaborate with others on this assignment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part II &ndash; Committing to a repository &ndash; 70%</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>(10%) Download and install Git on your laptop:<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"> http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>You are welcome to use a GUI client if you like, but as these will be different across platforms, examples and class discussion will focus exclusively on the command line version.</li>
                <li>If you are using Windows, after you install git, you will see "git-bash" this is the command line terminal you should use (rather than the built-in Windows one). It is a light-weight Linux-style command line terminal, that helps to run the git commands.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>(10%) Sign up for a free account at GitHub.com.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep in mind that what you commit to your public repositories will be visible to rest of the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>(5%) Create a new repository at GitHub for use in this class (e.g., cs246)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For the dropdown, &ldquo;add .gitignore&rdquo;, select Java. This will add default ignore options for things like *.class and *.jar files.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>(5%) Create a file, HelloWorld.java that simply displays &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; to the console.</li>
            <li>(10%) Commit your HelloWorld.java file to a local repository and push it to your GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>(10%) Change your HelloWorld.java program to display &ldquo;Hello GitHub World&rdquo;, and push this change to your GitHub repository.</li>
            <li>(5%) Create a branch on your local machine named, &ldquo;test&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>(5%) Change your HelloWorld.java program to display the line &ldquo;Testing&hellip;&rdquo; after the previous line (&ldquo;Hello GitHub World&rdquo;), and push this to a branch at GitHub named, &ldquo;test&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>(5%) Go back to your master branch, and remove the word &ldquo;World&rdquo; from the output, so that it now displays, &ldquo;Hello GitHub&rdquo;. Push this change to your GitHub repository (on the master branch).</li>
            <li>(5%) On your local machine, merge the changes from your test branch back into your master branch (the result should be a program that displays two lines &ldquo;Hello GitHub&rdquo; and &ldquo;Testing&hellip;&rdquo;). Push this to GitHub on your &ldquo;master&rdquo; branch.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part III &ndash; Using the history of a repository &ndash; 25%</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>(2%) Clone the following repository: https://github.com/sburton42/cs246-committedness.git</li>
            <li>(3%) Identify the most recent commit message that has been made to the repository.</li>
            <li>(3%) Identify the file that was changed in the most recent commit.</li>
            <li>(3%) Identify the message of the first commit to this repository.</li>
            <li>(3%) Identify the file that was added in the first commit.</li>
            <li>(3%) What time of day (hh:mm:ss) was the commit with the message &ldquo;adding three great classes&rdquo; made?</li>
            <li>(2%) Identify the commit message when the file &ldquo;file3.txt&rdquo; was added.</li>
            <li>(2%) The class Broken has a compile error. Identify the commit message of the revision in which it was broken.</li>
            <li>(2%) The class Fixed had a compile error at one point, but then was subsequently fixed. Identify the commit message of the revision in which it was fixed.</li>
            <li>(2%) The class Deleted was in the repository at one point, but has subsequently been deleted. Identify the commit message of the revision in which it was removed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
        <p>To &ldquo;submit&rdquo; your assignment, answer the quiz questions on I-Learn. You are required to collaborate with others on this assignment, however, do not just enter in the answer (e.g. a certain commit message) found by another student. You should be able to pull up the message on your own screen if you answer the question. Thus, you should not just share the &ldquo;answer&rdquo;, but rather, share the process to find the answer.</p>
