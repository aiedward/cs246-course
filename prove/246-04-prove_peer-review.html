        <h1>Peer Review XML Parsing Assignment</h1>

        <p>As an assignment this week, you need to assess your own code and that of others for the Spiritual Journal - XML Parsing assignment that you submitted last week.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this is to give you a chance to see other ways of approaching the task and styles of code and compare and contrast them with your own.</p>
    <p>Please follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In this discussion forum, start a new thread, and add a new post with your name as the title, then click "add attachments" and upload the zip file containing the source code (i.e., the Java files) for your solution to the XML Journal Parsing assignment.
        <li>Download the file: <a href="../attachments/246-04-burtonJournalParsing.zip" target="_blank">246-04-burtonJournalParsing.zip</a> which contains a working implementation of the project, look through how Br. Burton approached the problem, and compare it with your code.</li>
        <li>In addition to looking over Br. Burton's code, you will need to evaluate 3 submissions: your own code and then two of your peers.
        </li>
        <li>Evaluate your own code, according to the instructions below. Make sure to post your self-evaluation and comments as a reply to the thread you started in the dicussion forum.</li>
        <li><p>Evaluate the submissions of the two students whose forum posts were made immediately before yours. (If you were the first person, you may choose any two other students. If you were the second, look at the submission of the first person, and one other of your choice.)</p><p>For each of these two peers, follow the instructions below and leave your evaluation and comments as a reply to their thread.</p><p>In the interest of time, you do not necessarily need to try to run their code, just look through it and evaluate it to the best of your ability. In other words, if it looks like it should work, you can assume that it does. (For your own, you know if it works or not ;-) ).</p></li>
        <li>When you have finished your peer evaluations, take the "Peer Review XML Parsing Assignment" quiz in I-Learn that allows you to self-report that you finished this assignment.
    </ol>

    <h3>Evaluation Instructions</h3>

    <p>For evaluation, you will use the line items from the rubric that was originally posted with the assignment:</p>

    <div>
        <!--
        <ul>
            <li>10 - Classes are created for Journal, Entry, Scripture, and Topic</li>
            <li>15 - Annotation interface is created and implemented by Scripture and Topic (and used in the Entry class, such as: List&lt;Annotation&gt;)</li>
            <li>15 - Entry objects are correctly created and filled with date and content when the XML is parsed</li>
            <li>15 - Scripture and Topic objects are correctly created, filled with data and attached to Entry objects when the XML is parsed</li>
            <li>15 - Objects are iterated through to produce the correct output</li>
            <li>15 - Parsing methods are cohesive and easy to read</li>
            <li>10 - Strictly adhered to the code conventions</li>
            <li>5 - Collaborated and identified collaborators</li>
        </ul>
    -->
        <ul>
            <li>xx - Classes are created for Journal, Entry, Scripture, and Topic</li>
            <li>xx - Annotation interface is created and implemented by Scripture and Topic (and used in the Entry class, such as: List&lt;Annotation&gt;)</li>
            <li>xx - Entry objects are correctly created and filled with date and content when the XML is parsed</li>
            <li>xx - Scripture and Topic objects are correctly created, filled with data and attached to Entry objects when the XML is parsed</li>
            <li>xx - Objects are iterated through to produce the correct output</li>
            <li>xx - Parsing methods are cohesive and easy to read</li>
            <li>xx - Strictly adhered to the code conventions</li>
            <li>xx - Collaborated and identified collaborators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should copy and paste this list into your forum response, then for each item, replace the "xx" at the beginning with your evaluation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ex - Excellent</li>
            <li>Minor - Room for minor improvement</li>
            <li>Major - Room for major improvement</li>
            <li>Dev - Developing</li>
            <li>Missing - Missing or no attempt made</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, for each person (<b>including your own</b>), after looking at several different approaches, indicate one thing that was done well and one thing that could be improved.</p>
